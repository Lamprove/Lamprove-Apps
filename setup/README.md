# Setup
This folder contains setup files for installing a conda env if not already completed. 

The setup scripts here will run automatically when you create a new codespace from this repo. 

When creating a codespace for this repo:
* Select 'Code' and 'Create a codespace on main'. 
* The setup scripts will take about 4-5 minutes to run upon first startup. 
* Remember to open a new terminal and run ```conda activate lamprove-env``` before attempting to run your application.  
*New terminals can be opened by clicking '+' button at the top right of the bottom output window. If this is not visible, a terminal can be started from the menu at the top left of the created codespace.*
* Subsequent starts of the same codespace will not need to run this setup step.
